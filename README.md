# deep_learning_projects
This repository contains projects of DeepLearning Specilization courses offered by deeplearning.ai on cousera.

The Problems, requirements and datasets are the same, but the solutions are different from what provided in the courses, as I worked out them with my own understanding.

Besides the code itself, I included points that I thought quite important/tricky thus need extra attention in the **reflection part** of every project's 'README' file.
